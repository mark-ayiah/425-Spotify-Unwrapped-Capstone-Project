    \section{Abstract}\label{abstract}

This report analyzes the factors of a song that influence music
enjoyment using Spotify listening data received through a request to the
platform. The dataset includes variables such as track popularity,
loudness, danceability, acousticness, and other audio features. We
employ exploratory data analysis (EDA), LASSO regression, logistic
regression, and ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost to
predict whether a song was ``enjoyed'' or not. While the models showed
only modest accuracy (with AUC values ranging from 0.55 to 0.58), the
results suggest that Spotify likely leverages far more granular,
proprietary data about individual users that was not made available for
this analysis. The key takeaway is that companies like Spotify collect
and utilize highly detailed user metrics to curate personalized
recommendations, but these methods and the extent of data collection
remain opaque to the public. This raises important considerations about
data privacy and the effort platforms invest in understanding user
behavior.

    \section{Executive Summary}\label{executive-summary}

This report explores what makes a song enjoyable by analyzing Spotify
listening data. The goal was to uncover the key features of songs that
influence listening preferences and determine whether publicly available
data can predict which songs people enjoy. Using audio features such as
track popularity, energy, danceability, loudness, and acousticness, the
analysis applied both simple statistical models and more advanced
machine learning techniques.

The results showed that certain song characteristics are linked to
enjoyment. Songs that are popular, energetic, and easy to dance to were
more likely to be enjoyed, while quieter or highly acoustic songs were
less favored. However, despite identifying these trends, the models'
ability to predict enjoyment was limited, with accuracy hovering around
55-57\%. This means that, while some patterns could be found, the
publicly available data alone is not enough to fully explain why someone
enjoys a particular song.

The modest accuracy of these models suggests that Spotify's ability to
deliver highly personalized recommendations depends on far more detailed
and specific data than what is publicly shared. Beyond basic song
features, Spotify likely uses extensive behavioral data, such as when
users listen, their mood, habits, and patterns over time. It is also
possible that third-party data and other forms of personal
identification help refine their algorithms, giving the platform a
deeper understanding of individual preferences.

This raises important questions about transparency and data privacy.
Users benefit from accurate, personalized music recommendations, but
they often do not realize how much data is being collected and analyzed
to achieve this. Platforms like Spotify operate sophisticated systems
that rely on hidden, proprietary data, which gives them a significant
advantage in understanding user behavior but also leaves users in the
dark about how their information is used.

In conclusion, while this report highlights some factors that influence
song enjoyment, it also underscores the limits of publicly available
data. The findings point to the hidden power of proprietary data held by
streaming services, which allows them to create far more accurate and
tailored recommendations. Future work could explore richer datasets that
include listening behavior, time-based trends, and contextual factors to
better understand what truly drives music preferences.

    \section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Music streaming platforms like Spotify have transformed the way people
consume music, offering personalized recommendations based on listening
habits. These platforms promise to understand individual tastes,
curating playlists and suggestions tailored to each user. The ability to
predict what someone will enjoy listening to is an impressive technical
feat and imperative to the success of an entity such as Spotify, but it
also raises questions about the extent of the data they collect and the
methods used to generate these recommendations.

The motivation behind this project stems from a curiosity about the
factors that influence music enjoyment and how much can be inferred from
Spotify's publicly accessible data. While Spotify claims to provide a
personalized experience, it is unclear how much of that personalization
is driven by user listening patterns and song information versus
proprietary data and algorithms that remain opaque. This project seeks
to examine whether publicly available audio features and metadata can
effectively predict song enjoyment and, in turn, to highlight the
limitations of accessible data compared to what platforms like Spotify
may actually use.

The dataset for this analysis was obtained by request from Spotify and
contains various audio and song-level features, such as track
popularity, danceability, loudness, speechiness, and acousticness. Each
row represents a song listened to, with an outcome variable denoting
whether the song was ``enjoyed'' based on metrics like play count and
completion rate.

The remainder of this report is organized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Section 4 presents exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations,
  revealing relationships between features like loudness, danceability,
  and enjoyment.
\item
  Section 5 describes the predictive models applied, including LASSO
  regression, logistic regression, and ensemble methods such as Random
  Forest and XGBoost. The models' performance is evaluated, and key
  predictors are identified.
\item
  Section 6 focuses on the interpretation of the results, comparing
  models and discussing their limitations. The results underscore the
  modest predictive power of the available data.
\item
  Section 7 concludes the report with reflections on the findings and
  recommendations for future work. It highlights the hidden depth of
  Spotify's proprietary data and raises important considerations about
  data privacy and transparency.
\end{itemize}

Through this project, the aim is to shed light on how much can be
inferred from publicly available data, as well as its limitations.

    \section{Exploratory Data Analysis}\label{exploratory-data-analysis}

    To understand the data and prepare it for modeling, we conduct an
exploratory data analysis (EDA). This section details the steps taken to
investigate the data, uncover key patterns, and ensure the dataset was
ready for further analysis.

\subsection{Distribution of Number of
Plays}\label{distribution-of-number-of-plays}

The first step was to examine the number of plays for each song.
Understanding the spread of this variable helps identify whether
listening frequency is a useful signal for enjoyment.

    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{output/output_7_0.png}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    The histogram reveals that the majority of songs were played only once,
with a small subset receiving multiple plays. This initial insight
suggested the need to categorize songs into ``1 Play'' versus ``Multiple
Plays''.

\subsection{Categorizing Songs by Play
Count}\label{categorizing-songs-by-play-count}

To simplify the analysis, we divide songs into two categories, with one
representing single-play songs and the other being songs played multiple
times

    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{output/output_9_0.png}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    The bar chart shows a pretty even split between the two categories.

\subsection{Completion Rates}\label{completion-rates}

We next analyze the average completion rate for songs to see how fully
they were listened to.

    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{output/output_11_0.png}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    The histogram highlights a skewed distribution, with some songs having
very high completion rates even when only played once. This suggests
that high completion rates might indicate enjoyment.

\subsection{Defining ``Enjoyed'' Songs}\label{defining-enjoyed-songs}

Using the completion rate and play count, we create a binary column
enjoyed to identify songs that were either replayed or fully listened to
(completion rate â‰¥ 1.25).

    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{output/output_13_0.png}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    This bar chart confirmed a near-even split between songs classified as
``enjoyed'' and ``not enjoyed,'' providing a balanced dataset for
modeling.

\subsection{Exploring Audio Features}\label{exploring-audio-features}

We next the distribution of key audio features between ``enjoyed'' and
``not enjoyed'' songs. Features like danceability, energy, and loudness
were investigated.

The resulting plots (shown in Figure 1 in the appendix) showed clear
differences for certain features like danceability, where enjoyed songs
tended to score higher. Meanwhile, acousticness appeared lower for songs
classified as enjoyed, suggesting that quieter or highly acoustic songs
were less likely to be favored.

\subsection{Standardizing and Transforming
Features}\label{standardizing-and-transforming-features}

To address skewness (shown in Figure 2 in the appendix), we standardize
and transform key features like loudness, acousticness, and speechiness.
These transformations ensure that outliers do not disproportionately
influence the analysis. Loudness was standardized to have a mean of 0
and a standard deviation of 1. Features like acousticness, speechiness,
and liveness were log-transformed to reduce skewness. The updated
distributions revealed smoother, more comparable patterns between
enjoyed and not enjoyed songs across all features.

    \subsection{Checking for
Multicollinearity}\label{checking-for-multicollinearity}

Finally, we check for multicollinearity among the predictors, as it is
an assumption made by both LASSO regression and Logisic Classification
which are used later. We calculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
for each feature to detect highly correlated variables.

    
    
    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
               Feature       VIF
12             key\_1.0  3.088966

13             key\_2.0  1.978676
21            key\_10.0  1.959357
22            key\_11.0  1.933872
19             key\_8.0  1.889869
17             key\_6.0  1.867304
18             key\_7.0  1.814806
20             key\_9.0  1.739779
15             key\_4.0  1.651740
4         acousticness  1.489064
0         danceability  1.392902
14             key\_3.0  1.349805

9   time\_signature\_1.0  1.193122
8     track\_popularity  1.110048
3          speechiness  1.071115
6             liveness  1.059466
7                tempo  1.049386
    \end{Verbatim}

    

    All features have VIF values of below 5, indicating no severe
multicollinearity. With the data cleaned, transformed, and explored, the
next section will focus on building predictive models to understand
which features are most strongly associated with song enjoyment.

    \section{Modeling \& Analysis}\label{modeling-analysis}

This section describes the models and analyses conducted to determine
the factors influencing song enjoyment.

\subsection{Problem Setup and
Assumptions}\label{problem-setup-and-assumptions}

The goal is to predict whether a song is ``enjoyed'' based on its audio
features and metadata. Key assumptions include: 1. Binary (Logistic)
Classification Assumption: A song is either ``enjoyed'' or ``not
enjoyed,'' largely determined by play count and completion rate. 2.
Independence of Observations: Each song in the dataset is treated as an
independent observation. 3. No Multicollinearity: Predictors should not
be highly correlated. Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) were calculated
to confirm this. 4. Linear and Non-linear Relationships: Models were
chosen to capture both linear and non-linear associations.

The predictors (\(X\)) include: - Audio Features: danceability,
loudness, speechiness, acousticness, liveness, tempo\\
- Song Metadata: track popularity, time signature, key, genre The
outcome variable (\(y\)) is binary, where \(y = 1\) indicates an
``enjoyed'' song, and \(y = 0\) indicates otherwise.

\subsection{LASSO Regression}\label{lasso-regression}

LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression was
applied to identify important predictors and reduce overfitting by
shrinking coefficients. The model can be represented as:

\[
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j x_j \quad \text{subject to} \quad \sum_{j=1}^p |\beta_j| \leq t
\]

Where \(t\) is a tuning parameter. The regularization helps identify the
most relevant predictors.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Top Predictors:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{track\_popularity}: Strongest positive impact on enjoyment\\
  \item
    \texttt{speechiness} and \texttt{danceability}: More moderate
    positive impact\\
  \item
    \texttt{acousticness} and \texttt{liveness}: Negative impact
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Performance:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Mean Squared Error (MSE): \(0.243\)\\
  \item
    \(R^2\): \(0.02\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

LASSO's extremely low \(R^2\) reflects its limited predictive power,
highlighting the complexity of music enjoyment.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\subsection{Logistic Regression}\label{logistic-regression}

Logistic Regression was used for binary classification. The probability
of a song being enjoyed is modeled as:

\[
P(y = 1 | X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\left(\beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j x_j\right)}}
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  AUC: \(0.574\)\\
\item
  Interpretability: Coefficients provide insights into feature
  importance. For example, \(track\_popularity\) and \(danceability\)
  have positive associations with enjoyment, while \texttt{acousticness}
  has a negative association.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\subsection{Random Forest}\label{random-forest}

Random Forest, an ensemble method, was applied to capture non-linear
relationships. It constructs multiple decision trees and averages their
outputs.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Performance: AUC = \(0.5596\)\\
\item
  Feature Importance:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{track\_popularity}
  \item
    \texttt{speechiness}
  \item
    \texttt{acousticness}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

Logistic Regression outperformed Random Forest marginally, suggesting
that the data cannot currently model the complex relationship between
the music and the listener's preferences.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\subsection{Gradient Boosting and
XGBoost}\label{gradient-boosting-and-xgboost}

Boosting methods, such as Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, were applied to
further improve performance by iteratively learning from errors.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Performance Comparison:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Logistic Regression: AUC = \(0.574\)\\
  \item
    Random Forest: AUC = \(0.5596\)\\
  \item
    XGBoost: AUC = \(0.5558\)\\
  \item
    Gradient Boosting: AUC = \(0.5550\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The results show minimal differences across models, again indicating
that the predictors are insufficient for accurately modeling song
enjoyment.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\subsection{Evaluation of Models}\label{evaluation-of-models}

The table below summarizes the performance metrics:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
Model & AUC & Interpretability \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
Logistic Regression & 0.574 & High \\
Random Forest & 0.5596 & Moderate \\
Gradient Boosting & 0.5550 & Low \\
XGBoost & 0.5558 & Low \\
\end{longtable}

Logistic Regression provided the best trade-off between performance and
interpretability.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

The analysis reveals that while models like LASSO and Logistic
Regression identify key predictors (e.g., \texttt{track\_popularity} and
\texttt{danceability}), their predictive power remains limited. Ensemble
methods like Random Forest and XGBoost do not significantly improve
performance. This highlights the need for more granular or contextual
data, such as user mood or temporal patterns, to better understand music
enjoyment.

    \section{Visualization and Interpretation of the
Results}\label{visualization-and-interpretation-of-the-results}

    With the data prepared and explored, the next step was to build and
evaluate predictive models to determine which features were most
strongly associated with song enjoyment. In this section, we apply
multiple modeling techniques, including LASSO regression, Logistic
Regression, and ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost. These
models were assessed for their performance, and their results were
compared.

\subsection{LASSO Regression}\label{lasso-regression}

LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression was
applied to identify important predictors while controlling for
overfitting. LASSO uses regularization to shrink less informative
coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.

    
    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
                    LASSO Feature Coefficients
track\_popularity                      0.036461
speechiness                           0.021502
danceability                          0.011868
tempo                                 0.007267
key\_4.0                               0.006978
time\_signature\_3.0                    0.006128
loudness                              0.001941
key\_1.0                               0.000699
key\_6.0                              -0.001781
time\_signature\_4.0                   -0.004950
liveness                             -0.017703
acousticness                         -0.034998
    \end{Verbatim}

    
    
    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
        MSE  R-Squared
0  0.243579   0.020686
    \end{Verbatim}

    
    The model indicates that higher values of features like
track\_popularity, speechiness, and danceability increase the likelihood
of a song being ``enjoyed,'' while features such as acousticness,
liveness, and time\_signature\_4.0 have a negative impact. Among these,
track\_popularity emerges as the strongest predictor, suggesting that
more popular tracks are more likely to be enjoyed. Additionally, songs
with moderate speech content and higher danceability are favored,
whereas high acousticness reduces enjoyment. The model's performance,
with an R-squared of 2\% and a mean squared error of 0.24, reflects
modest predictive power, which is expected given the complexity of
behavioral preferences like song enjoyment. However, a classification
model may prove to be more effective at prediction.

    \subsection{Binary Classification (Logistic
Regression)}\label{binary-classification-logistic-regression}

Logistic Regression was used as a classification model to predict
whether a song was enjoyed (binary outcome). This model is simple yet
interpretable and serves as a baseline for comparison with more complex
methods.

    
    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
   Accuracy       AUC
0  0.557143  0.574137
    \end{Verbatim}

    
    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{output/output_27_1.png}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    The ROC curve shows an AUC of 0.574, indicating that the logistic
regression model performs only slightly better than random guessing (AUC
= 0.5). The curve's proximity to the diagonal line reflects the model's
limited ability to distinguish between ``enjoyed'' and ``not enjoyed''
songs. This suggests that the current features may not sufficiently
capture the patterns in song enjoyment, and the linear nature of
logistic regression may not be well-suited for the complexity of the
data. We will next try models that do not assume linear relationships
between the larget variable and the features.

\subsection{Random Forest Classifier}\label{random-forest-classifier}

The Random Forest algorithm, a non-linear ensemble method, was applied
to capture more complex relationships between features and the outcome.
This method builds multiple decision trees and averages their
predictions to improve robustness.

    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{output/output_29_0.png}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    While Random Forest typically outperforms Logistic Regression due to its
ability to capture complex patterns, in this case of predicting music
enjoyment, the simpler Logistic Regression model performed better. The
Logistic Regression model achieves an AUC of 0.5599, while the Random
Forest model slightly improves upon this with an AUC of 0.5644. To
thoroughly explore the options for prediction, however, we will evaluate
two other powerful ensemble methods: Gradient Boosting and XGBoost.
These boosting algorithms might capture patterns that both Random Forest
and Logistic Regression missed by learning from previous predictions.

    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{output/output_31_0.png}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    The comparison of the four models reveals remarkably similar
performance, with all models achieving AUC scores between 0.55 and 0.58.
Logistic Regression achieved the highest AUC of 0.5749, followed by
Random Forest (0.5596), XGBoost (0.5558), and Gradient Boosting
(0.5550). While all models performed better than random chance (AUC =
0.5), the marginal improvement suggests that predicting song enjoyment
based on audio features and metadata alone is a task that requires more
granular data. The similar performance across different model
complexities, from the simpler Logistic Regression to more complex
ensemble methods like XGBoost, suggests that the inherent subjectivity
of music preference may limit the predictive power of purely technical
audio features.

    \subsection{Genre Analysis}\label{genre-analysis}

This section explores the distribution of songs across consolidated
genres and their relationship with user enjoyment.

\subsubsection{Consolidating Genres}\label{consolidating-genres}

The first step in the genre analysis was to simplify the raw genre tags
into six overarching categories: Mainstream Hip Hop,
Underground/Alternative Hip Hop, R\&B, African/Diasporic, Lo-Fi, and
Other.

    After consolidating the genres, the distribution of songs across these
six categories was visualized using a bar chart. The resulting plot
highlights which genres are most prevalent in the dataset.

    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{output/output_36_0.png}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    From the chart, it is evident that Mainstream Hip Hop overwhelmingly
dominates my listening history, with significantly smaller contributions
from genres like R\&B, Other, and African/Diasporic.

\subsubsection{Enjoyment Across Genres}\label{enjoyment-across-genres}

Next, we explore the relationship between song enjoyment and genre. The
distribution of enjoyed versus not enjoyed songs was plotted
side-by-side for each genre, followed by a proportional analysis.

    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{output/output_38_0.png}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{output/output_38_1.png}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    The first plot shows the raw counts of enjoyed and not enjoyed songs
across genres. Notably, Mainstream Hip Hop has the largest number of
enjoyed songs, but it also contains a substantial portion of not enjoyed
tracks. In contrast, genres like African/Diasporic and
Underground/Alternative Hip Hop have fewer total songs but a higher
proportion of not enjoyed tracks. This may prove to be a challenge for
the predictive models, as there is clear imbalance across the different
genres.

    The logistic regression models, with SMOTE applied to address class
imbalance, showed varying performance across genres. Mainstream Hip Hop
and Other achieved the best results, with accuracy around 57-60\% and
AUC values of 0.56, indicating moderate predictive ability. Recall was
generally high, particularly for Underground/Alternative Hip Hop (0.63),
reflecting the model's strength in identifying ``enjoyed'' songs, though
precision remained lower. In contrast, African/Diasporic performed
poorly (AUC = 0.33), likely due to limited data. Overall, performance
improved for minority class predictions, but smaller genres still pose
challenges due to data scarcity.

    \subsection{K-Nearest-Neighbors for Enjoyment
Prediction}\label{k-nearest-neighbors-for-enjoyment-prediction}

To wrap up the genre analysis, we employ the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
algorithm to explore how well song enjoyment can be predicted using a
combination of audio features and genre information. KNN is a simple yet
effective classification method that assigns labels to data points based
on the majority class of their k closest neighbors in feature space.

By incorporating both genre data and audio characteristics like
danceability, energy, and tempo, we aim to determine whether these
attributes collectively influence the likelihood of a song being
enjoyed. This step helps assess if genre plays a significant role in
enjoyment prediction or if other song features are more critical.

    The plot shows the cross-validated accuracy of a K-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN) model as the number of neighbors k increases. The accuracy
improves consistently as k rises from small values, stabilizing around
k=27, where it reaches one of its peaks. This suggests that k=27 offers
an optimal trade-off: it balances the model's ability to generalize
without overfitting to noise, while still maintaining strong
interpretability compared to higher k-values. After k=27, the accuracy
fluctuates slightly but remains relatively stable around 54-55\%. This
stabilization indicates diminishing returns as k increases further.
Larger k-values smooth out predictions but may reduce the model's
sensitivity to more nuanced patterns.

Despite incorporating audio features and genre data, the model's best
accuracy remains modest (around 55\%). This suggests that listening
behavior may not be fully captured by the available data. Important
factors such as mood, context (e.g., time of day), personal associations
with songs, or unexplored song metadata (like lyrics or artist
familiarity) likely influence enjoyment and are absent from the current
dataset. Further enhancements, such as including temporal trends, song
sequencing, or contextual features, could better model these behaviors.

    \subsection{Experimenting With More Granular Notions of
Enjoyment}\label{experimenting-with-more-granular-notions-of-enjoyment}

\subsubsection{Granular Enjoyment Score}\label{granular-enjoyment-score}

Lastly, we propose an enjoyment score is designed to capture the degree
of enjoyment for each song based on three key components:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Completion Rate: The proportion of the song that was listened to,
  indicating engagement.
\item
  Play Count: The number of times a song was replayed, reflecting repeat
  enjoyment.
\item
  Track Popularity: Adjusts for song popularity to account for bias
  towards mainstream music.
\end{itemize}

These components are combined into a weighted score to reflect enjoyment
more precisely, defined as follows:

\[
\text{Enjoyment Score} = w_1 \times \text{Completion Rate} + w_2 \times \log(\text{Play Count} + 1) + w_3 \times \text{Track Popularity (normalized)}
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(w_1, w_2, w_3\) are weights to control the contribution of each
  component.
\item
  Logarithmic scaling for play count ensures diminishing returns for
  songs played many times.
\item
  Normalization of track popularity keeps it in line with other features
  for balanced influence.
\end{itemize}

This granular score provides a richer, continuous measure of song
enjoyment compared to a binary ``Enjoyed'' or ``Not Enjoyed'' outcome.

    To optimize the weights for the enjoyment score components, a logistic
regression model was used to predict whether a song was ``enjoyed.'' The
weights for completion rate, play count, and track popularity were
optimized using \texttt{scipy}'s minimize function, which aimed to
maximize the predictive performance measured by ROC-AUC. The objective
function calculated the negative ROC-AUC for each combination of
weights, allowing the optimizer to adjust the contributions of each
component iteratively. The resulting optimal weights of \(w_1 = 0.3\),
\(w_2 = 0.3\), and \(w_3 = 0.4\) provide the best balance to predict
enjoyment based on the data. The distribution of enjoyment scores can be
found below:

    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    Having previously explored binary enjoyment classification (enjoyed
vs.~not enjoyed), we now shift to predicting enjoyment scores as a
continuous variable for a more nuanced understanding of user preferences
by capturing varying levels of enjoyment rather than reducing the
outcome to a binary decision.

By applying regression models, we aim to identify the specific song
attributes and features that influence enjoyment scores the most. We
again employ Ridge and Lasso Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to
determine their predictive accuracy and feature importance.

    The machine learning models' performance in predicting music enjoyment
scores reveals several interesting patterns. Looking at the evaluation
metrics, all models showed relatively consistent RMSE values around
0.26, indicating similar prediction accuracy across different
approaches. However, the RÂ² scores, which measure the proportion of
variance explained by the models, show more notable differences.

Linear Regression and Ridge Regression performed best with RÂ² scores
around 0.045 (4.5\%), followed by XGBoost at approximately 0.042
(4.2\%). The Random Forest and Lasso models showed slightly lower
performance with RÂ² scores around 0.03-0.04 (3-4\%). Granted, these RÂ²
values are relatively low, providing more evidence that predicting music
enjoyment is a complex task that may involve factors beyond the
available features. However, they still provide valuable insights into
feature importance, revealing the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Audio Characteristics: The top three predictors are loudness,
  acousticness, and tempo, suggesting that the technical aspects of a
  song's production and composition significantly influence listener
  enjoyment.
\item
  Vocal Elements: Speechiness and liveness rank highly (4th and 5th),
  indicating that the presence and quality of vocal components play a
  substantial role in listener engagement.
\item
  Emotional and Energy Factors: Valence (emotional positivity) and
  energy appear as the 6th and 7th most important features, showing that
  a song's emotional content and energy level are meaningful predictors
  of enjoyment.
\item
  Musical Structure: Danceability and instrumentalness round out the top
  features, demonstrating that the overall musical structure and
  composition style contribute to listener enjoyment.
\item
  Genre Impact: The presence of \texttt{genres\_Other} in the top 10
  suggests that genre classification has some predictive power, though
  relatively lower than the audio features.
\end{enumerate}

    \section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

This analysis investigated the factors influencing music enjoyment using
publicly available Spotify audio features and metadata. By applying a
range of statistical and machine learning models, including LASSO
regression, logistic regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, we seek to
predict whether a song would be ``enjoyed'' based on attributes like
track popularity, danceability, loudness, and acousticness. Despite the
sophistication of the methods employed, model performance plateaued at
around 55-57\% AUC, demonstrating only modest predictive power. The
results revealed that while features such as track popularity,
danceability, and speechiness were positively associated with enjoyment,
and acousticness and liveness were negatively associated, these
attributes alone fail to fully capture the complexity of listening
preferences.

The limited accuracy achieved in this analysis raises a critical point
about the nature of data available to the public. Streaming platforms
like Spotify are known for their exceptional ability to curate highly
personalized recommendations, which cannot be explained solely by the
audio features and metadata analyzed here. This discrepancy suggests
that Spotify---and likely other streaming services---possess far more
granular data about individual users. Such data likely includes
behavioral patterns, temporal listening trends, mood associations,
device information, and possibly third-party data sources that build
comprehensive personal profiles. These platforms may also integrate data
from other means of personal identification, such as social media
behaviors, location history, or interactions with advertisements, to
construct robust models that predict user preferences with far greater
accuracy.

The plateau observed in this study serves as indirect evidence of the
extent and sophistication of the proprietary data Spotify leverages. The
limited predictive power of publicly accessible data highlights its
constraints, while simultaneously underscoring the opaque nature of data
collection practices employed by these platforms. Users benefit from
highly tailored recommendations, but this comes at the cost of extensive
data collection, often with limited transparency regarding what data is
collected, how it is used, and whether it is shared with third parties.

In conclusion, while this analysis sheds light on the relationship
between song attributes and user enjoyment, it also highlights the
critical role of proprietary, granular data in driving the success of
music recommendation systems. Future research could incorporate richer
behavioral and contextual data---such as listening times, sequential
song patterns, and emotional sentiment---to better approximate the
models used by platforms like Spotify. Additionally, this raises broader
questions about data privacy and transparency: as consumers, we must
remain aware of how much streaming services know about us and the extent
to which our personal data fuels their algorithms.
